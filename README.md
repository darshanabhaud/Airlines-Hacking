ðŸ§  Introduction

Airlines Hacking Vulnerability Analyzer is a Python-based tool developed to identify and analyze vulnerabilities in the aviation sector, focusing on ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), in-flight WiFi systems, and aircraft maintenance networks. The project utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to simulate and demonstrate attack scenarios, detect anomalies in network traffic, and raise awareness about potential cyber threats in airline digital infrastructure.
